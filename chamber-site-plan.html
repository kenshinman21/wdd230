        <h1>Nacogdoches Chamber of Commerce</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div class="column left">
            <div class="section"><h2>Site Purpose <button class="edit">edit</button></h2><p>The Purpose of my website is to make a chamber of commerce website that will attract local business in Nacogdoches. 
            In order to make the purpose of this website come to fruition our company must increase website traffic by at least 50% and we as a community must increase the enrollment amount to at least 5 entities. 
            The goal of increasing website traffic could be measured by using ethical and trustworthy resources like Google Analytics tools. 
            I think all these goals could be done by at least a months time if we all work together. 
            I could measure the increase in membership enrollment by using conversion tracking. 
            The target audience for this website is for any small local business in Nacogdoches. </p></div>
            <div class="section"><h2>Questions <button class="edit">edit</button></h2><p>What events will the chamber be holding this month that promote business-to-business networking?
            Where can I find contact information for the chamber's board of directors?
            What has been the population growth in the area?
            </p></div>
            <div class="section"><h2>Color Schema <button class="edit">edit</button></h2><p>The reason I chose the color scheme Green and brown is with a simple line of logic.
            Knowing that Nacogdoches is a small town that values strong conservative values like family and strength and taking the setting of this small town.
            Nacogdoches is located in a forested area despite the city's infrastructure and new construction projects. Taking all that information into account as well as a little
            about color theory it seemed only reasonable that Green and Brown should be the color choices.
            </p></div>
            <div class="section"><h2>Typography <button class="edit">edit</button></h2><p>The reason for my given choice of Typography can be summed up as some assumptions
            as well as my life experience in this rural city. I know that the community values honesty, professionalism, and tradition so it make sense to use Serif type fonts for the titles or bold words and
            Sans-Serif for everything else.

            <div class="section"><h2>Answers <button class="edit">edit</button></h2><p>This chamber will be holding educational seminars over small business.
            We will also host get togethers where we can network with fellow local businessmen. 
            You can find the contact information for the chamber's board of directors on the chamber webpage. 
            The population growth for our small town has been slow but steady over the years.
